<h1>Employee Attrition Analysis</h1>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>In this project, I utilized Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of employee turnover across various departments. I began by performing data transformation, where I cleaned the dataset by removing inconsistent and faulty data to ensure accuracy. I also added new columns where I categorized widespread data values from important columns.
My primary objective was to identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition and uncover patterns and trends in turnover. Through various data transformation operations, I gained a broader view of the data, making it easier to detect trends and extract meaningful insights.
The Power BI dashboard I created provided a comparative view of the data, enabling me to analyze it from multiple perspectives. Using Drillthrough-filters, I could dive deep into specific departments and extract valuable insights that helped to have a better interpretation of employee turnover dynamics.

<h3>Data Source:</h3>
<p>For this project, I utilized a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.</p>
<p><b>Extended Employee Performance and Productivity Data:</b> It contained data of over 1 lakh employees along with details like Age, Gender, Department, Job title, Years at company, Performance score, Satisfaction score etc.</p>
<h3>Tool Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Power BI Desktop</li>
  <li>Power BI Query Editor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Cleaning and transformation:</h3>
<p>The dataset contained no null values, so no null handling operations were necessary. However, there were some faulty records that needed attention. For example, certain employees aged between 20 and 24 were listed as having 7 to 9 years of experience, which was inconsistent. I cleaned up such erroneous entries to ensure data accuracy.
Additionally, I created new columns to offer a more comprehensive perspective of the dataset. In these columns, I grouped continuous variables like 'Age,' 'Years at Company,' and 'Monthly Salary' into distinct categories. This categorization is crucial for simplifying widespread data values and uncovering meaningful insights from the data.
