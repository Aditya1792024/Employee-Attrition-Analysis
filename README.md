<h1>Employee Attrition Analysis</h1>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>In this project, I utilized Power BI to conduct a comprehensive analysis of employee turnover across various departments. I began by performing data transformation, where I cleaned the dataset by removing inconsistent and faulty data to ensure accuracy. I also added new columns where I categorized widespread data values from important columns.
My primary objective was to identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition and uncover patterns and trends in turnover. Through various data transformation operations, I gained a broader view of the data, making it easier to detect trends and extract meaningful insights.
The Power BI dashboard I created provided a comparative view of the data, enabling me to analyze it from multiple perspectives. Using Drillthrough-filters, I could dive deep into specific departments and extract valuable insights that helped to have a better interpretation of employee turnover dynamics.
